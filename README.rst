FROST locations on a map
========================

This repo contains some basic example on how to query ``Locations`` and ``HistoricalLocations``
from a `FROST-Server <https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FROST-Server>`_ instance and place them
on a web map using Open Source mapping APIs like `Leaflet.js <https://leafletjs.com/>`_.
